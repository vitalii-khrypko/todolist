# Todolist (MVC Architecture)

Todolist is a task management application built with **JavaScript** following the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture**. This structure ensures better code organization, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

## Technologies
- **JavaScript** – core programming language.
- **MVC Architecture** – for structured application logic.
- **HTML5 & CSS3** – for layout and styling.
- **LocalStorage** – for persisting tasks across sessions.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Data persistence using **LocalStorage**.
- Follows the **MVC pattern**, separating logic into:
  - **Model** – manages the data and business logic.
  - **View** – handles the UI representation.
  - **Controller** – connects the Model and View, managing user interactions.
